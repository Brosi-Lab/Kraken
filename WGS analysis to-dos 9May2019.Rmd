## to dos

* `truepos.krak.family` (`.genus`, `.species`): something is off about the aggregation of these files. Specifically, the `species` file should have the most rows, as it has the most unique cases. Instead, it is the opposite: `family` has the most rows, then `genus`, then `species`. This needs to be fixed so that it is the other way around.
    + may be relatively straightforward to fix using the `unique` function?
    + this is in the `merge kraken data and sample metadata` code chunk, around line 241
